# SmoothX

It's a template created in **Html**, **CSS** and **Javascript**.

In this I have used **Service Worker** to improve loading speed of the website.
This Code is Minified for faster reloading of pages. The **Service Worker** files saves the files such as **.css, .js, .json, .html, .png, etc** in the localstorage and uses it.

> Warning: The Code is **Minified** it will be harder to read, for better readability and understanding of code use this link. https://github.com/iambhvsh/surecdn/archive/refs/heads/readable-code.zip
